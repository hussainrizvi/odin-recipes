    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Twice-cooked polenta stands in for noodles in this lasagna loaf that can be served straight from the pan or inverted onto a platter for a nicer presentation. With four layers of polenta adding a light, fluffy, almost soufflé-like texture and multiple layers of cheesy filling and meat sauce, this is definitely the best polenta recipe I've ever had. Serve it alongside bitter greens if desired.

                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley, or to taste></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare polenta: Bring water and salt to a boil over high heat. Whisk polenta into the boiling water and continue whisking until it starts to thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until polenta is soft and has lost its grainy texture, 25 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove polenta from the stove and quickly whisk in butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer polenta to a silicone baking liner (or oiled foil or parchment paper). Spread it out evenly almost to the edges into an 8x13-inch rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and smooth out the top with your hands. Place a baking sheet on top and press slightly to further flatten.</li>
        <li>Slide the silicone liner and polenta onto the baking sheet and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove polenta from the refrigerator and cut, from one long edge to the other, into 8-inch long strips.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling: Stir ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mozzarella, salt, pepper, cayenne, egg, and parsley in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Place one strip of polenta into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Spread 1/3 of the filling on top as evenly as you can. Top with about 1 cup hot meat sauce. Repeat polenta-filling-sauce layers twice more. Place the last piece of polenta on top, then gently shake and tap the pan to settle the contents. Place the loaf pan on top of a sheet pan to catch any spills while baking. Loosely wrap the top of the loaf pan with foil, making sure it's not touching the polenta.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, discard foil, and let rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide onto 6 plates. Garnish with parsley and serve with additional sauce.</li>
    </ol>
